In this section, we will highlight some use cases that you can fully implement in your app to **enhance your user experience**.

## Coupons / Discounts

One way to take advantage of HOKO is by embedding your own **coupons or discounts** on your links. To do this, start by creating a new smart link and adding a new `metadata` entry to it, like the following:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "coupon": "20"
}
{% endhighlight %}


After doing that, your link is fully ready to transmit metadata to your users. The following code shows how you can put this into practice with a very simple and straightforward example that shows an alert to the user displaying how much money they received with your coupon:


{% highlight objective-c %}
// AppDelegate.m

// addHandlerBlock: is going to be called every time your application opens a
// deeplink. if you prefer, you can focus on specific deeplink routes, to give
// a coupon/discount, by using mapRoute:toTarget:
[[Hoko deeplinking] addHandlerBlock:^(HOKDeeplink *deeplink) {
    // check if the deeplink has metadata for 'coupon'
    if (deeplink.metadata[@"coupon"]) {
        NSNumber *coupon = deeplink.metadata[@"coupon"];
        // notify the user that they successfully redeemed your coupon
        UIAlertController *alertController = [UIAlertController
                                              alertControllerWithTitle:@"Congratulations"
                                              message:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"You just earned a $%@ through a coupon because you clicked on the right link!", coupon]
                                              preferredStyle:UIAlertControllerStyleAlert];
        UIAlertAction *action = [UIAlertAction actionWithTitle:@"Awesome!" style:UIAlertActionStyleDefault handler:nil];
        [alertController addAction:action];
        [self.window.rootViewController presentViewController:alertController animated:YES completion:nil];
    }
}];
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight swift %}
// AppDelegate.swift

// addHandlerBlock() is going to be called every time your application opens a
// deeplink. if you prefer, you can focus on specific deeplink routes, to give
// a coupon/discount, by using mapRoute(_:toTarget:)
Hoko.deeplinking().addHandlerBlock { (deeplink: HOKDeeplink) -> Void in
    // check if the deeplink has metadata for 'coupon'
    if let coupon = deeplink.metadata?["coupon"] {
        // notify the user that they successfully redeemed your coupon
        let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "Congratulations",
                                                message: "You just earned a $\(coupon) through a coupon because you clicked on the right link!", preferredStyle: .Alert)
        let action = UIAlertAction(title: "Awesome!", style: .Default, handler: nil)
        alertController.addAction(action)
        self.window?.rootViewController?.presentViewController(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
