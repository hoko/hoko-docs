HOKO is a deep linking management platform + open source SDK for apps, coupled with a tracking
dashboard to monitor the performance of every link you share. You can easily have links to within
your apps, that work for every platform in a easy and fast way.

Our platform allows all your links to send users straight into any specific section within your app.
This means skipping web browsers, home buttons and even the default screen, which is not always the
best place to land a user.

HOKO works across platforms and devices, and can be used for driving direct downloads, creating
personalized engagement experiences, and simply converting any link into a smart one.

# How do I get started?

The integration process is as easy as peeling a banana! We spent half of our time building the best
deep linking platform for you, and the other half making sure that it was extremely simple to use.

**1.** First you have to [register or sign in](https://hokolinks.com/applications "Sign in to HOKO")
to your dashboard

**2.** Let the wizard guide you through the 3 steps process.

It shouldnâ€™t take more than 15 minutes until you can create your first smart link. Ok, maybe it
takes a little longer than peeling a banana.
