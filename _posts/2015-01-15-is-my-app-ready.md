Any app is ready for deep linking, and actually every app in the world will end up using this
technology at some point. Now it’s a great time for you to differentiate from other apps, but not
many years from now, apps without deep linking will start to get relegated from the app ecosystem.

We encourage you to start experiencing all the great benefits of it, and at HOKO we have the
perfect "free forever" plan to start exploring the power of mobile deep linking.

For a deeper insight you can [contact our amazing team](mailto:support@hokolinks.com). We are always
researching and designing new business cases on how to take the most out of deep linking and HOKO
and we are here to help you implement it the best way.
