Allow your users to invite others through referrals. We will use smart
links to identify the user sending the invite and once the invited user opens the app
we are going to display a personalized landing page to make the experience
extra special and welcome.

Take a step further and combine referrals with coupons to increase its efficiency.
We are going to start by preparing your app to generate and share smart links.

## Step 1: Sharing the smart link

Generate referrals with smart links through our SDK using `query parameters` or `metadata`.
It's up to you to decide which method suits you. Moreover, you can use and combine both
if you need to.

#### Option 1: Smart links with query parameters

With `query parameters` your links will have extra information visible, e.g.
`http://app.hoko.link/invitation?referrer=OfjaiSD8h9238`. These links are easier to create
and to be shared because there is no need for pre-configurations.

In this example we are going to have a look on how to create a smart link with
parameters as a referral link, using the SDK and its `generateSmartlinkForDeeplink` method.

![Sharing](/assets/images/share-android.png)

Then, we are going to share the message using Android `Intent.ACTION_SEND`, so Ricardo can pick
the messaging app that we wants to send the message. Let's have a look at the code
needed to generate and share the smart link:

{% highlight java %}
private void setupInviteButton() {
  // R.id.inviteButton would be the ID you would give to that button
  mInviteButton = (Button)findViewById(R.id.inviteButton);

  // Add a click event listener to generate smart links
  mInviteButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
      HashMap queryParameters = new HashMap();
      queryParameters.put("referrer", mCurrentUser.getName());

      Deeplink deeplink = Deeplink.deeplink("invite", null, queryParameters);

      // Generate the smart link based on a deep link
      Hoko.deeplinking().generateSmartlink(deeplink, new LinkGenerationListener() {
          @Override
          public void onLinkGenerated(String smartlink) {
            // Build the message together with the smart link
            String inviteText = "Join me, this app is a-mazing! " + smartlink;
            Intent inviteIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
            inviteIntent.setType("text/plain");
            inviteIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, inviteText);

            // And... it's ready! Let's present the share popup to the user
            startActivity(Intent.createChooser(inviteIntent, "Share"));
          }

          @Override
          public void onError(Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
            showErrorPopup();
          }
      });
    }
  });
}

{% endhighlight %}

Thanks to `Deeplink.deeplink` this will generate a smart link like
`http://app.hoko.link/invitation?referrer=OfjaiSD8h9238`. Alternatively, you could create the same
smart link using `metadata`.

#### Option 2: Smart links with metadata

Smart links with `metadata` requires you
to assign and load data when creating and parsing the smart link. Nevertheless, these links are
shorter and clearer because they don't use HTTP query parameters,
e.g. `http://app.hoko.link/invitation`.

Metadata are ideal to hide and control sensitive data. They also have the
advantage of supporting unlimited meta data, unlike query parameters where you are limit by the
length of the URL.

Use the `metadata` argument in `Deeplink.deeplink` to pass a hash with the respecting metadata
to be saved with the smart link. Read more information about
[metadata](http://support.hokolinks.com/android/android-deeplinking/#metadata).

## Step 2: Personalized landing page

Now that we know how to create and share referral smart links, we must handle
these links once the users opens the app. We are going to
make it extra special by displaying which friend invited the user and what is the reward.

![Landing page](/assets/images/landing-page.png)

In this simple example we are going to parse the deeplink generated by the smart link and
present the appropriate view to the user. We are also going to pass the name of the user (in this
case Ricardo) that referred the new user. You can go even further by getting the user
picture and other information from your back end.

{% highlight java %}
// Map route and Activity to be called when opening a smart link
@DeeplinkRoute("invite")
public class InviteSignUpActivity extends Activity {
  // Inject the value of the query parameter into this variable
  @DeeplinkQueryParameter("referrer")
  private String mReferrerName;

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    // Was this Activity manually started or through a smart link?
    if (!Hoko.deeplinking().inject(this)) {
      // If it was manually called
    } else {
      // Verify if the invite link has a referrer in the query parameters
      if (mReferrerName != null) {
        // Present your personalized landing page with the referrer name
        showInviteSignUpWithReferrer(mReferrerName);
      } else {
        // The deep link does not contain any information about the referrer.
        showRegularSignUp();
      }
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

That's it. You now have a customized referral experience that your users are going to love!
