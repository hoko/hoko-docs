Furthermore, our lightweight SDK allows you to skip the tedious job of configuring Apple and Google’s new mobile deep link standards. Last but not least, HOKO also offers a simple tracking dashboard, which gives you a way to monitor the performance of all deep links driving your incoming traffic.

# How do I get started?

The integration process is as easy as peeling a banana! We have spent half of our time building the best deep linking platform for you, and the other half making sure that it was extremely simple to use.

**1.** First [sign in](https://hokolinks.com/applications "Sign in to HOKO")
to our dashboard.

**2.** Let our wizard guide you through the process.

It shouldn’t take more than 20 minutes until you can create your first smart deep link. Ok, maybe it takes a little longer than peeling a banana. :)
