A URL scheme is what identifies your app deep links and how other apps can link into it. All of URL
schemes are formed by a scheme name, followed by a colon character (":"), and the remainder of the
URI called the scheme-specific part.

The scheme name is a string that you choose for your own apps, so if your app is called **Megastore** your URL scheme should be **megastore** and its identifier should be **com.company.megastore**.
