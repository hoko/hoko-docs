description: Learn how connect HOKO with third-party solutions.

Integrations are a great way to connect HOKO with third-party solutions. Take advantage of their features to further explore the data generated by your app and smart links.

One common use case to use third-party integrations is to segment and attribute your HOKO data by different parameters such as devices or OS versions using analytics and marketing services that are specialized in that matter like *Mixpanel*, *Kissmetrics*, *Google Analytics* and so on.

For each integration that you activate we'll asynchronously send every event that occurs in our system. Currently we have events for:

- **Clicks** – when a user clicks a smart link
- **Opens** – when a user ends up opening the app after clicking the smart link
- **Installs** – when the user installs your app
- **Deferrers** – when the user is taken through the app store to install your app

You will find these events in your third-party solution hence you can then perform analytics actions using them. We are working on further and better integrations as times goes by, so keep checking the integrations page for new additions.
