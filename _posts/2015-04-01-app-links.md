"The Android M Developer Preview introduces support for App Links, which improves upon existing link handling by allowing app developers to associate an app with a web domain they own. When developers create this association, the platform can automatically determine the default app used to handle a particular web link and skip asking users."

## SHA256 fingerprint

Android M introduced the support for App Links to enhance its mobile deep linking user experience. This will give your users a more seamless experience when using your Android App.

Enabling this technology involves creating a signature to allow your smart links to take advantage of this enhancement and quickly open your app.

The process is very simple. The only thing that you must provide us is a SHA256 fingerprint key to authenticate the association between your app and HOKO.

You can use the Java key tool to generate the fingerprint using the following command:

{% highlight java %}
keytool -list -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore
{% endhighlight %}

A valid SHA256 fingerprint is something like "6C:EC:C5:0E:34:AE....EB:0C:9B"
