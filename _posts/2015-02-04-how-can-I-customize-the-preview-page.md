The standard preview template displays content scraped from the desktop web page
associated with the smart link. If you don't provide a desktop page or don't have a web
platform configured, we will present a simple dialog with the action buttons.

If you would like to customize the look and feel of this page, you can use static content that
will override the default information. Check the documentation on
[how to customize the preview page](http://support.hokolinks.com/misc/misc-previews/).
