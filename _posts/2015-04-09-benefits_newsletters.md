description: Re-engage with your users with smart newsletters.

Newsletters are a great way to re-engage your users and make them aware of your products.
Nevertheless itâ€™s important to provide a great experience once the user engages with the newsletter
to increase its effectiveness and further re-engagements.

Newsletters usually drive traffic from e-mail clients to your website or app but most of the times
is either one way of the other. Moreover, mobile deep links to apps usually drive users to welcome
or sign up views. Truth be told, mobile deep links don't work if the app is not installed.

Thus app owners decide to use links to their web sites to guarantee a functional experience. The
user can then click on a smart banner or button to jump from the website to the app.

All these jumps hinder the experience. Mobile developers create beautiful apps that are designed for
premium experiences on mobile devices. Hence, the optimal experience should in fact be taking users
from Newsletters to Apps and straight to the product view and through the App Store to install the
app if they have to.

That is exactly what our smart links do. Smart links are links that take the user into different
paths depending on the environment where the link is opened thus making the user move forward
without breaking the experience.

## Lazy Smart Links

You will probably create hundreds of newsletters using your e-mail campaign software. Creating smart
links manually for every link in a newsletter would then require a lot of copy and paste work.

We are introducing Lazy Smart Links for Newsletters that will make this extra work unnecessary.
Tapping on a lazy smart link triggers the creation of smart link that will follow your templates
and rules and drive the user to your app or to your predefined fall back location, i.e. your
website, the app store or a custom URL.

Creating a lazy smart link is extremely easy. All you need to do is to create a hyperlink that
follows a specific format and includes the mobile deep link that will direct the user to your app.
