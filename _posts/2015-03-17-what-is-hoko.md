The HOKO framework is an easy to use deep linking framework that enables an app to map deep linking routes to actual behavior in the app. This behavior can include showing a particular screen or performing a certain action. HOKO also allows users to be redirected to your app regardless of the platform they are on.

After integrating HOKO, you will be able to open your app by using URI links such as...

{% highlight html %}
your.app.scheme://<mapped_route>/<route_param>?<query_params>
{% endhighlight %}
