Smart links allow you to design flexible user experiences without having to worry about the fact that users will open their links across different devices, platforms, and contexts. Smart links will identify the opening device, and always select the best route for the user. And everything happens in 2 milliseconds. With the power of smart links, you are not only guaranteeing the best experience for your users, but you are actually driving up organic downloads every time you “fish” a new user that doesn’t have you app installed.
