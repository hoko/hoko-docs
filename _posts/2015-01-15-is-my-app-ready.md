Any app is ready for deep linking, and actually every app in the world will end up using this technology at some point. Now it’s a great time for you to differentiate from other apps, but no many years from now, apps without deep linking will start to get relegated from the app ecosystem.

We encourage you to start experiencing all the great benefits of it, and at HOKO we have the perfect “free forever” plan to start exploring the power of mobile deep linking.

You should take a look into our Fireballs, if you didn’t yet, and for a deeper insight you can contact our amazing Biz Dev team. They are always researching and designing new business cases on how to take the most out of deep linking and HOKO, and they are here to help you implement the best Fireballs for you.
