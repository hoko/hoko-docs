HOKO is **a deep linking management platform + open source SDK for apps, coupled with an advance tracking dashboard to monitor the performance of every link you share.**

Our platform allows all your links to send users straight into any specific section within your app. This means skipping web browsers, home buttons and even the App homepage, which is not always the best place to land a user.

HOKO works across platforms and devices, and can be used for driving direct downloads, creating personalised engagement experiences, and simply converting any link into a smart one.

#How do I get started?
The integration process is as easy as peeling a banana! We spent half of our time building the best deep linking platform for you, and the other half making sure that it was extremely simple to use.

**1.** First [sign in](https://hokolinks.com/applications "Sign in to HOKO") to our dashboard

**2.** let our wizard guide you through the 3 steps process.

It shouldnâ€™t take more than 15 minutes until you can create your first smart link. Ok, maybe it takes a little longer than peeling a banana.
