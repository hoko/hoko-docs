description: Learn how connect HOKO with third-party solutions.
---

***Disclaimer:** These integrations are unofficial plugins developed by HOKO. HOKO has no commercial/contractual link to these companies and is not responsible for any charges or contractual
issues. Before activating a third-party integration you should be aware of the pricing
and contractual implications of having data, also known as events or data points, pushed to your integrated account.*

Integrations are a great way to connect HOKO with third-party solutions. Take advantage of external
tools to further explore the data generated by your smart links.

Use case for third-party integrations to segment and attribute HOKO data by different parameters (e.g. platforms, OS versions, countries, event types), using analytics and marketing
services that are specialized in that matter like *Mixpanel*, *Kissmetrics*, *Google Analytics*.

We'll asynchronously send every event that occurs in our system to each activated integration.
Currently we have events for:

- **Clicks** – when a user clicks a smart link
- **Opens** – when a user ends up opening the app after clicking the smart link
- **Installs** – when the user installs your app
- **Deferrers** – when the user is taken through the app store to install your app

You will find these events as they occur in your third-party solution. We are working on further integrations as time goes by, so keep checking the integrations page for new additions.
