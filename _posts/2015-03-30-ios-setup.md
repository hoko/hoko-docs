description: Full iOS Setup Guide. Learn how to integrate HOKO SDK in your app.

If you haven't installed the SDK yet, please head over to the [QuickStart](/quickstart/ios) guide to get our SDK up and running in Xcode. Note that we support iOS 5.0 and higher.

### HOKO

HOKO is an application-wide framework. To provide this behavior with a simple integration, HOKO works by setting up a singleton and accessing its modules through convenience accessors. The setup should occur on the application's `AppDelegate` subclass on the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method.

{% highlight objective-c %}
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  [Hoko setupWithToken:@"YOUR-APP-TOKEN"];
  // The rest of your code goes here...
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight swift %}
func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
  Hoko.setupWithToken("YOUR-APP-TOKEN")
  // The rest of your code goes here...
}
{% endhighlight %}

Calling `setupWithToken:` will automatically check if your application is in **debug mode** by checking for developer provisioning profiles, in case they are found in the running application, the SDK will be sure to upload your deep linking routes and application icon to the HOKO dashboard.

To add support for your own domains (<a href="http://support.hokolinks.com/setting-up-a-custom-domain/" target="_blank">see "Setting up a custom domain"</a>), setup the iOS SDK using `setupWithToken:customDomains:` as following:

{% highlight objective-c %}
#import <Hoko/Hoko.h>

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
  didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  [Hoko setupWithToken:@"YOUR-APP-TOKEN"
         customDomains:@[@"your.custom.domain.com"]];
  // The rest of your code goes here...
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight swift %}
func application(application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
  Hoko.setupWithToken("YOUR-APP-TOKEN",
      customDomains: ["your.custom.domain.com"])
  // The rest of your code goes here...
}
{% endhighlight %}
