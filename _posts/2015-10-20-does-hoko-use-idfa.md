HOKO is a full deep linking solution for iOS, Android and web apps in a single platform. We have
committed to simplifying developers’ life, and to do so, we have taken away the pain of building
your own deep linking technology from scratch and we provide you a smarter deep linking solution so
you can focus on building great app features and better UX.

Furthermore, our lightweight SDK allows you to skip the tedious job of configuring Apple and
Google’s new mobile deep link standards. Last but not least, HOKO also offers a simple tracking
dashboard, which gives you a way to monitor the performance of all deep links driving your incoming
traffic.

# Which platforms does HOKO support?

Currently, HOKO supports iOS, Android, and desktop web applications. Yet we are also expanding our
SDK to other frameworks, so if you are really looking forward to using HOKO [let us know](mailto:support@hokolinks.com) which
framework you use!

# What are the sizes of the SDKs?

We aim to make the most complete and light SDKs possible.
With that in mind, the SDK sizes for the latest versions are:

* **iOS** &#8594; *approx.* 99 KB

* **Android** &#8594; *approx.* 72 KB

# How do I get started?

The integration process is as easy as peeling a banana! We have spent half of our time building the best deep linking platform for you, and the other half making sure that it was extremely simple to use.

1. First [sign in](https://hokolinks.com/applications "Sign in to HOKO")
to our dashboard.

2. Let our wizard guide you through the process.

It shouldn’t take more than **20 minutes** until you can create your first smart deep link. Ok, maybe it takes a little longer than peeling a banana. :)
